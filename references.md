Background Knowledge
-----
- Design of Machinery (Robert L. Norton, McGraw Hill)
  * 機構為機械的組合，目的為傳遞動作與能量。
  * Newton's law: F = m * a = m * L / t^2
  * Design Process: Needs ==> Background Research ==> Goal ==> Ideation and Invention ==> Analysis ==> Select ==> Prototyping
  * Kinematics: Degree of freedom, type of motion
  * Position ==> Velocity ==> Acceleration Analysis
  * Instant center of velocity
  
- F = P * A
