Arduino Install
-----
For Mac users, it's easy to install Arduino, but hard to get USB driver.
Many out-of-date information to waste your time.

For OS X 10.10, Yosemite, here is the solution of USB driver:
http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=261375.30

or

1. Install the driver http://www.wch.cn/downloads.php?name=pro&proid=178

2. Run this(Terminal):  sudo nvram boot-args="kext-dev-mode=1"

3. Restart the computer


ArduBlock Install
-----
###### Why ArduBlock? For kids who already using Scratch but have no experience on C language, it's a good way to use Ardublock.

Ardublock is a piece of JavaScript code, find it on internet and put it into the directory:
  In Mac, /Users/abu/Documents/Arduino/tools/ArduBlockTool/tool/

Then, you will see it on Arduino IDE.


Atom - for code editing
-----
###### Why Atom? Because the IDE of Arduino is not good to use. Atom or Sublime are easy to use, and Atom is free. So, I suggest Atom as external editor.

I like to use Atom. Atom also got Arduino packages. Free and perfect. Google it, and it's easy to install.


Github - for version control
-----
###### Why version control? Get sync with your partners, and reserve the path you've done. Trust me, you can't remember everything.

Go to http://github.com to register one account. This is good for version control and synchronization.


Linkage Simulator
-----
###### Why run simulation before make it? I think make-and-modify is a good approach. But the iteration is too slow if you don't get good tool. This simulator is to tell kids what will their design work visually, and mathematically.

There are 2 tools on iPad, which is very good for linkage simulation:
