Find the better way to make a movement:

1. Drive by syringes:
-----
The movement is linear, and easy to handle by hand. It's good choice.
F = P * A, P is the same in on liquid. So, large area will generate larger force.


2. Drive by motor
-----
Find an example of Arduino: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Knob

Made it and found that MG90S seems do not generate enough torque... The spec is 1.8kgf-cm :

To Learn
-----

1. F = P * A

2. Voltage divider rule.

3. Torque = Force * Distance


Next step:
-----

1. Put MG90S on real platform to try the torque.

2. Buy bigger servo motor.
